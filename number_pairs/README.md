# Number Pairs

## Description

In this Kata the aim is to compare each pair of integers from 2 arrays, and return a new array of large numbers.

Note: Both arrays have the same dimensions.

# Example:

```javascript
let arr1 = [13, 64, 15, 17, 88];
let arr2 = [23, 14, 53, 17, 80];
getLargerNumbers(arr1, arr2); // Returns [23, 64, 53, 17, 88]
```
